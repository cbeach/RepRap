o  Succesfully print an object
	o  Configure Skeinforge
		-  Print Bart a cake :)

o  Upgrade drive system
	o Upgrade from a threaded rod system to a belt-driven system
		Requires:
		  *  Belts and pulleys from McMaster-Carr
		  *  Machineshop access for machining motor mounts.
		  	
o  Upgrade extruder
	o  Upgrade to Mk7 stepstruder
		Requires:
		  *  Mk7 Extruder from makerbot industries

o  Upgrade motors
	o  Upgrade to brushless servos
		Requires:
		  *  Brushless motors w/ attached encoders
		  *  Gekko Drives
o  3D Scanner
	o  Build a scanner out of Kinnects
		Requires:
		  *  3 Kinnects

o  Extruder Development
	o  Grayscale extruder
		-  Two channel stainless extrude head
		-  Extruder controller board
		   Features:
		     -  Drive five steppers and one dc motor
		     -  Plenty of power (propeller? ARM?)
		Requires:
		  *  Machineshop Access
		  *  Mechanical Engineer
		  *  Electrical Engineer (Wicker)
		  *  Custom Firmware (Me)

	o  CMYKW Extruder
		-  Five channel stainless extrude head
		-  Extruder controller (same as grayscale
		Requires:
		  *  Machineshop Access		
		  *  Mechanical Engineer
		  *  Electrical Engineer (Wicker)
		  *  Custom Firmware (Me)

	o  Software Stack Upgrade
		-  The entire software stack will need an upgrade to handle 
		   color
		   -  New gcodes will need to be added to the fireware to
		      the extra functionality
		   -  The host software (ReplicatorG) may not need the upgrade
		   -  Skeinforge will need the most extensive upgrade, color 
		      will add a great deal of complexity to the gcode 
		      generation.  Possibly needing color lag to be taken into
		      consideration.
		   -  The stl format will need to be modified to contain color 
		      information
		-  This group will be heavily involved but the bulk of the work
		   will be done by the RepRap community.
